# discord-bot
Simple Discord bot
# Running this
```sh
git clone https://github.com/spekies/discord-bot.git
```
Make sure to change the last line with your respective bot token if you are running this!
```sh
python -m venv path/to/venv && source venv/bin/activate && pip install discord.py requests && python ./discord-bot/main.py
```
The above command is meant to be ran in a shell like Bash, which assumes you have cloned this repo, and changed the bot token at the last line.
